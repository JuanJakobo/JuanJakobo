### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I like to do stuff with the Pocketbook ebook reader. I created for example an App to access [Nextcloud](https://github.com/JuanJakobo/Pocketbook-Nextcloud-Client), [Miniflux](https://github.com/JuanJakobo/Pocketbook-Miniflux-Reader) or to [write texts on it](https://github.com/JuaJakobo/Pocketbook-Texteditor).
Furthermore I like to play with different stuff. ([Examples](https://github.com/JuanJakobo?tab=repositories))
